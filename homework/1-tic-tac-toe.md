#Facebook Wall Exercise

You are going to implement a basic facebook wall using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##What you're given

You're given one HTML file and one CSS file. This page contains one fixed-size div. This div will represent the wall. Anytime you post something to the wall, it will go inside this div.

##What you have to do

Your page needs to have the following:

* A title up top that identifies who's wall it is. (Mine would be "Manish's Wall").
* One textbox that contains the content that will go on the wall.
* One submit button that takes the content in the textbox and puts it in the wall.
