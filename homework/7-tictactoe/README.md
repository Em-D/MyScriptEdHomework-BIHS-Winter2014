#Tic Tac Toe

You are going to implement a single player tic-tac-toe game like http://ostermiller.org/calc/tictactoe.html. 

###Setup

1. Log into Cloud9 **using your Github account**.
2. Find the "ScriptEd-BIHS-Winter2014" project. Open it.
3. Run the following commands in the terminal: 
  ``git remote set-url origin git@github.com:dopeboy/ScriptEd-BIHS-Winter2014.git``
  <br/>
  ``git pull``
  ``git remote set-url origin git@github.com:INSERT_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME_HERE/MyScriptEdHomework-BIHS-Winter2014.git``

    A new folder called "7-tictactoe" should appear with just one file: README.md. If it doesn't, call one of the instructors over.
 
###What you have to do

Your page needs to have the following:

1. A title up top with your name and the text "Tic-tac-toe game" 
2. A 3x3 grid of squares. Each square must have a numerical ID.
3. A reset button somewhere.

Your page needs to do the following:

1. X's always go first. Everytime the user clicks on an empty square, the appropriate letter should show.
2. If there are 3 of the same letters horizontally, veritically, or diagonally, the game ends and text should be printed saying who won.
3. Everytime the user clicks on the reset button, the grid and any other text should be reset.

Once you're done with this phase, submit your code to Github only. Run in the terminal: 
  <br/>
  ``git add *``
  <br/>
  ``git commit -u -m "new homework"``
  <br/>
  ``git push origin master``

 
###Submission Checklist

This homework is due on **03/27 by midnight**. One submission per group.

Before submitting your homework, you must perform the following:

1. Make sure all your files are in the "4-memory-game" folder.
2. Run in the terminal: 
  <br/>
  ``git add *``
  <br/>
  ``git commit -u -m "new homework"``
  <br/>
  ``git push origin master``
3. At this point, log into your github and check that your files are in your repository. If they're not, do not proceed.
4. Go to http://clownfish.io and submit it.
