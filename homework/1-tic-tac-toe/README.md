#Facebook Wall Exercise

You are going to implement a basic facebook wall using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##What you're given

You're given one HTML file and one CSS file. This page contains one fixed-size div. This div will represent the wall. Anytime you post something to the wall, it will go inside this div.

##What you have to do

Your page needs to have the following:

1. A title up top that identifies who's wall it is. (Mine would be "Manish's Wall").
2. One textbox above your wall and a button next to it.

Your page needs to do the following:

1. Once the user types in the textbox and clicks the button, the text should appear in the wall. 
2. Once you've completed (1), add the ability to comment on wall posts. 

##Bonus

Snapchat-ify your wall so that each message disappears after 5 seconds.
