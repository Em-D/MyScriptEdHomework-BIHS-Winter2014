#Flickr Search Engine

You are going to write a search engine that searches for picture on Flickr.


###Setup

1. Log into Cloud9 **using your Github account**.
2. Find the "ScriptEd-BIHS-Winter2014" project. Open it.
3. Run the following commands in the terminal: 
  ``git remote set-url origin git@github.com:dopeboy/ScriptEd-BIHS-Winter2014.git``
  <br/>
  ``git pull``
  ``git remote set-url origin git@github.com:INSERT_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME_HERE/MyScriptEdHomework-BIHS-Winter2014.git``

    A new folder called "8-flickr-api" should appear with just one file: README.md. If it doesn't, call one of the instructors over.
 
###What you have to do

Your page needs to have the following:

1. A text box where users can enter in their query.
2. A submit button that executes the search.
3. A div below the above that contains the search results.

Your page needs to do the following:

1. Once the user has typed in their query and clicked on the button, they should see pictures that match their search criteria.

Once you're done with this phase, submit your code to Github only. Run in the terminal: 
  <br/>
  ``git add *``
  <br/>
  ``git commit -u -m "new homework"``
  <br/>
  ``git push origin master``

###Submission Checklist

This homework is due on **05/08 by midnight**. 

Before submitting your homework, you must perform the following:

1. Make sure all your files are in the "8-flickr-api" folder.
2. Run in the terminal: 
  <br/>
  ``git add *``
  <br/>
  ``git commit -u -m "new homework"``
  <br/>
  ``git push origin master``
3. At this point, log into your github and check that your files are in your repository. If they're not, do not proceed.
4. Go to http://clownfish.io and submit it. Be sure to select the "github" option when uploading your files.
