#03/14

The first step of this project will involve your group producing a grid using HTML and CSS.

###What you have to do

Your page needs to have the following:

1. A title up top that identifies who's wall it is. (Mine would be "Manish's Wall").
2. One textbox above your wall and a button next to it.

Your page needs to do the following:

1. Once the user types in the textbox and clicks the button, the text should appear in the wall. 
2. Once you've completed (1), add the ability to "like" your own posts.
